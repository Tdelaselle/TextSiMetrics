# TextSiMetrics
A textometric tool measuring syntaxic, grammatical and semantic similarities between Greek texts, tested on biblical verses.

**TextSiMetrics** is a candidate for Biblissima+ "innovation portail" call for proposals (see https://projet.biblissima.fr/fr/actualites/quatrieme-appel-manifestation-interet-biblissima-2024-2025). 
_/!\ The repository is still under development_

# Project abstract

The TextSiMetrics project aims to develop a digital tool for measuring textual similarity based on
syntax, vocabulary, semantic fields or grammatical categories. Independently of each other, these
measures, tested for AMI 2025 on the Greek biblical corpus (Septuagint and New Testament), quantify
degrees of similarity between textual passages, in this case verses - or sets of verses -, enabling the
identification and characterization of intertextual phenomena through various analyses: classifications
of pairs of textual fragments according to one or more similarity measures, graphical representations
of these measures (and their positions) between two large sets of fragments, diagrams combining all
the measures between two fragments. In addition to its immediate application to the biblical corpora
provided by BiblIndex in data.biblissima, this tool will eventually be used on all ancient Greek corpora.
